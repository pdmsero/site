**SUMMARY**

Britain faces an acute housing crisis. Housing is now the least affordable it has been for 148 years, since Victorian Britain. In contrast to what happened during the industrial revolution, employers today are blocked from hiring more due to a shortage of nearby new homes for workers. Investors are less likely to invest if firms cannot get the workers they need.

New homes must respond to the economic needs of the country. They must ultimately serve the Government's central mission of growth.

Living standards have been squeezed as the growth in rental costs has outstripped incomes.

Economic evidence shows that for new towns to be worthwhile, they need to be in or near existing high-wage opportunities.

Achieving the growth mission will involve allowing settlements that can generate more good jobs to build up and out – using underutilised bits of 'grey belt', doing more with brownfield, improving and making better use of land in underinvested council estates, and more.

One of the ways cities have built 'out' in the past is through masterplanned extensions. Edinburgh New Town, most of Bath, Newcastle's Grainger Town, and Pimlico were all built in this way.

Successful agglomerations such as Aberdeen, Edinburgh and Manchester need more transport infrastructure to allow them to realize the full benefits of their existing housing. Leeds's successful tech and finance industries will benefit if the long-overdue tram system is finally built. York could benefit from a 'New Town' in the form of an urban extension.

Labour has the strongest pro-housing mandate of any government since Attlee. It should pursue this mandate in part through designating and building new towns around cities with severe housing shortages, where affordability is worst and where job markets are the strongest.

**CHALLENGE & OPPORTUNITY**

The UK has invested less per head in the physical fabric of our homes than any other high-income Western country. Most of the high price of UK homes is attributable not to high quality construction, but to the high price of the underlying land and planning permission. We have failed to plan for enough homes where needed for many years. Fixing this will raise Britain's growth closer to its potential. Economic evidence shows that we can deliver more growth by building homes where workers currently have to pay the most to live within reach of good jobs. This will remove barriers for workers, deepen agglomeration effects and accelerate the formation of high-growth clusters.

Britain today benefits strongly from its agglomeration economy. It is core cities and clusters that are home to some of the UK's most promising firms such as Cambridge's Silicon Fen or Salford's MediaCity. Firms in city centre locations account for 14% of British jobs and 25% of higher-skilled services jobs in 'exporting' activities. The strength of agglomeration is particularly pronounced in the southeast and east of England.

The extraordinary power of agglomeration could hardly have a more surprising history than that of the town of Middlesbrough. Although it is now a regionally prominent and politically important town with a population of nearly 150,000, Middlesborough's growth is remarkably recent. As late as 1801, it was home to just 25 people, and would likely have remained small were it not for the relentless transformative power of the Industrial Revolution.

With the extension of the Stockton & Darlington Railway to the village in 1830 to bring coal to the coast, followed by the discovery in 1850 of iron ore in the nearby Cleveland Hills, Middlesbrough experienced explosive growth. By 1891, its population had surged to over 75,000, earning it the moniker "Ironopolis".

Today's economic landscape demands a different approach. While the abundance of natural resources had driven urban growth in the past, modern agglomeration benefits stem from knowledge spillovers, deep labor markets, and the clustering of complementary services. The most successful new towns will be those that can tap into these modern drivers of economic growth.

For new towns to be a success and achieve Government ambitions of strong growth, they must be built in locations that reflect the demands of the economy. High land values are a good indicator of where current housing shortfalls exist and where the economy would benefit most from new homes.

An extension to the town of Maidenhead, at Taplow, has a strong economic growth case. Maidenhead has great rail connections and a strong local economy. It is an attractive area for people seeking more affordable housing outside of London.

At peak times, Taplow currently has four trains per hour which get to central London in 40 minutes. Maidenhead has six, two of which reach Paddington in 23 minutes. Recent public investment in the Elizabeth line has added additional passenger capacity that could be better leveraged.

The local jobs market is strong with neighbouring Slough boasting the highest concentration of company HQs outside of London. In Windsor and Maidenhead, 82% of residents are employed, higher than both the national average of 75% and the wider Southeast region's rate of 79%.

The Government could pass an Act for a Taplow New Town, an extension onto the successful towns of Maidenhead and Slough. The Act would define the area covered and give the Secretary of State powers to build new infrastructure. The proposed area covers 5.8 square km (580 hectares). At a gentle medium density of 50 homes per hectare and assuming 20% public, green and commercial use, Taplow new town could accommodate over 20,000 homes or 40,000 people.

The suggested site is entirely contained within the Beaconsfield constituency, which has among the most unaffordable housing in the country. The new town would be compact enough to encourage active travel; a resident at the top of Taplow New Town could cycle to the station in 12 minutes.

The Secretary of State, using powers granted through a Taplow New Town Act, can issue a Compulsory Purchase Order to buy the land at existing use values, grant permissions for development and then sell the land to developers at the new increased land value to fund the Government's investment in the area. The raised funds should be used for the creation of vital public services such as schools and GP clinics in addition to Government priorities such as new social homes.
