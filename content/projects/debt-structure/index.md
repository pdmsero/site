abstract: "We extend the standard  SEIR  model to include consumption and labour
  decisions of households to capture endogenous variations in the transmission
  rates of a viral infection in the presence of aggregate uncertainty about
  policy intervention.   We explore and contrast the economic and
  epidemiological effects of various policy interventions:  a  baseline
  laissez-faire decentralised equilibrium with no policy  intervention,  severe
  restrictions,  moderate restrictions, and a conditional lockdown based on the
  number of hospital admissions.   In the baseline version of the model,  the
  endogenous response of economic agents in a perfect foresight equilibrium with
  no policy uncertainty leads to a  reduction of output of  nearly60%.   This is
  associated with a  very large decrease in welfare,  which is reduced in all
  the scenarios in which policy can be implemented,  even if the government
  never decides to do so. However,  we find that these gains to welfare are
  small in magnitude compared to the welfare cost of the pandemic and that the
  social welfare associated with no intervention increases relative to all of
  the intervention scenarios as the pandemic progresses.  This suggests that
  while policy measures may be optimal ex-ante, in the absence of a plausible
  vaccine or treatment, support for restrictions may wane considerably over
  time."
