title: Endogenous Distancing
abstract: "We extend the standard SEIR model to include consumption and labour
  decisions of households to capture endogenous variations in the transmission
  rates of a viral infection in the presence of aggregate uncertainty about
  policy intervention. We explore and contrast the economic and epidemiological
  effects of various policy interventions: a baseline \\textit{laissez-faire}
  decentralised equilibrium with no policy intervention, severe restrictions,
  moderate restrictions, and a conditional lockdown based on the number of
  hospital admissions. In the baseline version of the model, the endogenous
  response of economic agents in a perfect foresight equilibrium with no policy
  uncertainty leads to a reduction of output of nearly 60%. This is associated
  with a very large decrease in welfare, which is reduced in all the scenarios
  in which policy can be implemented, even if the government never decides to do
  so. However, we find that these gains to welfare are small in magnitude
  compared to the welfare cost of the pandemic, and that the social welfare
  associated with no intervention increases relative to all of the intervention
  scenarios as the pandemic progresses. This suggests that while policy measures
  may be optimal \\textit{ex ante}, in the absence of a plausible vaccine or
  treatment, support for restrictions may wane considerably over time."
