abstract: "We  extend  the  standard  SEIR  model  to  include  con-sumption  and  labour  decisions  of  households  to  capture  endoge-nous variations in the transmission rates of a viral infection in thepresence  of  aggregate  uncertainty  about  policy  intervention.   Weexplore  and  contrast  the  economic  and  epidemiological  effects  ofvarious  policy  interventions:  a  baseline  laissez-faire  decentralisedequilibrium  with  no  policy  intervention,  severe  restrictions,  mod-erate restrictions, and a conditional lockdown based on the numberof  hospital  admissions.   In  the  baseline  version  of  the  model,  theendogenous response of economic agents in a perfect foresight equi-librium  with  no  policy  uncertainty  leads  to  a  reduction  of  outputof  nearly60%.   This  is  associated  with  a  very  large  decrease  inwelfare,  which  is  reduced  in  all  the  scenarios  in  which  policy  canbe  implemented,  even  if  the  government  never  decides  to  do  so.However,  we  find  that  these  gains  to  welfare  are  small  in  magni-tude  compared  to  the  welfare  cost  of  the  pandemic,  and  that  thesocial welfare associated with no intervention increases relative toall of the intervention scenarios as the pandemic progresses.  Thissuggests that while policy measures may be optimal ex ante, in theabsence of a plausible vaccine or treatment, support for restrictionsmay wane considerably over time."
