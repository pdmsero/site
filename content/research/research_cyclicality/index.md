This research investigates the cyclical pattern of research spending and its implications for business cycle theory. Using industry and firm-level data on research spending and value added, we revisit the debate over the cyclical pattern of R&D and its implications for Schumpeter's opportunity cost hypothesis.

## Key Findings

The results overwhelmingly suggest that there is a significant degree of smoothing in research spending, which implies both:
- Pro-cyclical behavior in its growth rate 
- Counter-cyclical behavior in the share of R&D on output

Evidence supports a modified version of the opportunity cost hypothesis, with firms investing counter-cyclically in research as measured by its ratio with respect to the sum of R&D and capital expenditures.

## Methodology

The study examines:
- Industry and firm level data on research spending
- Value added metrics
- Impact of financial constraints  
- Cyclical patterns in different economic conditions

## Empirical Support

Established theories for the observed pro-cyclical behavior were formally tested, with those based on the demand-pull idea receiving significantly more empirical support than alternatives such as internal and/or external financial constraints.

## Implications

This research provides important insights for:
- Business cycle theory
- R&D investment strategies  
- Economic policy making
- Understanding firm behavior during economic fluctuations

The findings suggest that while R&D spending shows pro-cyclical tendencies in growth rates, firms actively work to smooth their research investments across business cycles, indicating sophisticated strategic planning in research investment decisions.
